// Exercise 1
// The code logs 1 to the console. The bar variable that is logged in line 7 is the one declared in line 1. The second bar variable in line 3 is unknown to the rest of the program because functions are block scoped.

//Exercise 4
// The code does not log anything to the console. The return statement in line 4 ends the function execution, preventing the console.log in line 4 from running.

//Exercise 5
// The code doesn't log anything to the console. It only returns the value of the words argument concatenated with the "!!!!".
